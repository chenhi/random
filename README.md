# random
These are some random scripts I made for convenience and fun.

mc_circle: Approximates circles in a square grid, as in Legos or Minecraft, for building circular structures on such square grids.

checkpw: For checking if a password has appeared in any pastes.

nothanks: A card game.  Eventually will write an AI to play it.

ridge_lasso: A little script for drawing contours and gradient descent paths in ridge and lasso regression.
