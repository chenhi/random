Some scripts to play the game No Thanks!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Thanks!_%28game%29
Per rules players can hide information, but since it's all publicly determined I prefer to just have it in the open.

nothanks.py: Game logic.

playgame.py: Run to play the game in a single terminal.  All information is public so this can work.

server.py / client.py: For playing the game over some connection.  In progress.

train.py: For training an AI to play the game.  Barely started.
