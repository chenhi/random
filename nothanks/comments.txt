p = number of players = 	3	4	5	6	7
c = number of total chips =	33	44	55	54	49	
n = number of cards = 		33	33	33	33	33
m = number of active cards =	24	24	24	24	24

The most naive state space for No Thanks! is:
(cpn)^2 <= 128,119,761 <= 130,000,000
log = 8

The naive game tree complexity is:
2^(m/p) * 24!
log = 31
i.e. the players take 2^m actions, and the number of random seeds is 24!
